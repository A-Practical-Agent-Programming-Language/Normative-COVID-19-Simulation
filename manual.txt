usage: 2APL/SimpleEpiDemic Disease Simulation
       [-h] --config CONFIGURATION [--threads THREADS]
       [--log-properties LOGPROPERTIES] [--connect-pansim]

A ecological simulation environment for  simulation  of human acceptance of
measures aimed at reducing spread of novel diseases

named arguments:
  -h, --help             show this help message and exit
  --config CONFIGURATION
                         Specify the TOML configuration file

Runtime optimization:
  --threads THREADS, -t THREADS
                         Specify  the  number   of   threads   to  use  for
                         execution (default: 8)
  --log-properties LOGPROPERTIES
                         (default: logging.properties)
  --connect-pansim, -c   If this argument is  present,  the simulation will
                         run  in  PANSIM  mode,  meaning  it  will  sendthe
                         generated behavior to  the  PANSIM environment. If
                         absent,  no  PANSIM   connection  is  required,but
                         behavior is not interpreted (default: false)
