measures aimed at reducing spread of novel diseases

named arguments:

                         Specify the location  of  the  file containing the
                         details of  individual  agents  in  the artificial

                         details  of  the  households   in  the  artificial
                         population
  --activityfile ACTIVITYFILES [ACTIVITYFILES ...], -af ACTIVITYFILES [ACTIVITYFILES ...]
                         Specify the  location  of  the  file(s) containing
                         all the  activities  of  all  the  agents  in  the
                         artificial population
  --locationsfile LOCATIONSFILES [LOCATIONSFILES ...], -lf LOCATIONSFILES [LOCATIONSFILES ...]
                         Specify the location  of  the  file containing all
                         the activity locations of  all  the  agents in the
                         artificial population
  --statefile STATEFILES [STATEFILES ...], -sf STATEFILES [STATEFILES ...]
                         Specify the location  of  the  file containing all
                         the activity locations of  all  the  agents in the
                         artificial population

Tunable parameters:
  The parameters that define the  distributions from which agent properties
  will be randomly  sampled.  These  parameters  dictate  probabilities for
  various reasoning factors that  determine  how  agents  will deviate from
  default behavior

  --fraction-liberal FRACTIONLIBERAL, -l FRACTIONLIBERAL
                         Probability that  a  household  will  be  assigned
                         liberal. The remaining houeholds  will be assigned
                         as conversative (default: 0.5)
  --liberal-mode MODELIBERAL, -lm MODELIBERAL
                         The value towards  which  the  normal distribution
                         from which government attitude  for liberal agents
                         will be sampled. A  sampled  value  of 1 indicates
                         agent  is  highly  likely   to  follow  government
                         directives while a value of  0 indicates the agent
                         is highly  unlikely  to  follow  agent  directives
                         (default: 0.6)
  --conservative-mode MODECONSERVATIVE, -cm MODECONSERVATIVE
                         The value towards  which  the  normal distribution
                         from which  government  attitude  for conservative
                         agents will  be  sampled.  A  sampled  value  of 1
                         indicates  agent  is   highly   likely  to  follow
                         government  directives   while   a   value   of  0
                         indicates the agent is  highly  unlikely to follow
                         agent directives (default: 0.6)

Runtime optimization:
  --iterations ITERATIONS, -i ITERATIONS
                         Specify the  number  of  iterations  to  run  this
                         simulation (default: 2147483647)
  --seed SEED, -s SEED   Specify a  seed  to  use  for  random  operations.
                         Default  is  -1,  indicating   no   seed  is  used
                         (default: -1)
  --threads THREADS, -t THREADS
                         Specify  the  number   of   threads   to  use  for
                         execution (default: 8)
  --connect-pansim, -c   If this argument is  present,  the simulation will
                         run  in  PANSIM  mode,  meaning  it  will  sendthe
                         generated behavior to  the  PANSIM environment. If
                         absent,  no  PANSIM   connection  is  required,but
                         behavior is not interpreted (default: false)
