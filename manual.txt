Tunable parameters:
  The parameters that define the  distributions from which agent properties
  will be randomly  sampled.  These  parameters  dictate  probabilities for
  various reasoning factors that  determine  how  agents  will deviate from
  default behavior

  --fraction-liberal FRACTIONLIBERAL, -l FRACTIONLIBERAL
                         Probability that  a  household  will  be  assigned
                         liberal. The remaining houeholds  will be assigned
                         as conversative (default: 0.5)
  --liberal-mode MODELIBERAL, -lm MODELIBERAL
                         The value towards  which  the  normal distribution
                         from which government attitude  for liberal agents
                         will be sampled. A  sampled  value  of 1 indicates
                         agent  is  highly  likely   to  follow  government
                         directives while a value of  0 indicates the agent
                         is highly  unlikely  to  follow  agent  directives
                         (default: 0.6)
  --conservative-mode MODECONSERVATIVE, -cm MODECONSERVATIVE
                         The value towards  which  the  normal distribution
                         from which  government  attitude  for conservative
                         agents will  be  sampled.  A  sampled  value  of 1
                         indicates  agent  is   highly   likely  to  follow
                         government  directives   while   a   value   of  0
                         indicates the agent is  highly  unlikely to follow
                         agent directives (default: 0.6)

Runtime optimization:
  --start-date STARTDATE
                         Specify the date corresponding  to  the first time
                         step. This option  is  used  to  potentially align
                         the  model  with  real-world  data,  both  in  the
                         produced output,  as  in  for  the  activation  of
                         norms.
                         If this option  is  omitted,  the  first time step
                         will be assigned the date  when  the first norm is
                         activated. Format is YYYY-MM-DD
  --iterations ITERATIONS, -i ITERATIONS
                         Specify the end date (YYYY-MM-DD, only if --start-
                         date is set*) or number  of iterations to run this
                         simulation. This parameter is  ignored when pansim
                         is connected by using the "-c" flag.
                         Make  sure  when  using   dates  to  specify  this
                         argument AFTER --start-date (default: 2147483647)
  --seed SEED, -s SEED   Specify a  seed  to  use  for  random  operations.
                         Default  is  -1,  indicating   no   seed  is  used
                         (default: -1)
  --threads THREADS, -t THREADS
                         Specify  the  number   of   threads   to  use  for
                         execution (default: 8)
  --node NODENAME        Specify the  name  of  this  node,  to distinguish
                         output   files   if   multiple   nodes   are   run
                         simultaniously (default: -1)
  --descriptor DESCRIPTOR
                         Allows to specify a  string  that  will be used in
                         the naming scheme of output files
  --log-properties LOGPROPERTIES
                         (default: logging.properties)
  --connect-pansim, -c   If this argument is  present,  the simulation will
                         run  in  PANSIM  mode,  meaning  it  will  sendthe
                         generated behavior to  the  PANSIM environment. If
                         absent,  no  PANSIM   connection  is  required,but
                         behavior is not interpreted (default: false)
