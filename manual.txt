measures aimed at reducing spread of novel diseases

named arguments:
  -h, --help             show this help message and exit
  --config CONFIGURATION
                         Specify the TOML configuration file

Calibration:
  Arguments used for calibrating the behavior model

  --mode-liberal MODELIBERAL, -ml MODELIBERAL
                         The mode of  the  government attitude distribution
                         of liberal voting agents
  --mode-conservative MODECONSERVATIVE, -mc MODECONSERVATIVE
                         The mode of  the  government attitude distribution
                         of liberal voting agents
  --disease-seed-days DISEASESEEDDAYS
                         The number of days at  the beginning of simulation
                         to seed the  --disease-seed-number  of agents with
                         an  infected  state.  If  this  argument  is  also
                         specified  in  the  TOML  configuration,  the  CLI
                         value takes precedent. If  no  value is specified,
                         no agents are seeded with the disease
  --disease-seed-number DISEASESEEDNUMBER
                         The  number  of   agents   at   the  beginning  of
                         simulation to seed  during  the initial --disease-
                         seed-days  with  an   infected   state.   If  this
                         argument   is   also   specified   in   the   TOML
                         configuration, the CLI  value  takes precedent. If
                         no value is specified,  no  agents are seeded with
                         the disease
  --disease-seed-additional-frequency ADDITIONALDISEASEDAYS
                         A number of  days  between  additional  seeding of
                         infectious  agents.  After   initial  seeding  has
                         finished, an  additional  --disease-seed-number of
                         agents will  be  seeded  with  an  infected  state
                         every --disease-seed-additional-frequency days. E.
                         g., if the initial number  of  days is 5, and this
                         value is 10, agents  will  be  seeded  on the 1th,
                         2nd, 3th, 4th, 5th, 10th,  20th,  30th etc days of
                         the  simulation.   If   this   argument   is  also
                         specified  in  the  TOML  configuration,  the  CLI
                         value takes precedent. If  no  value is specified,
                         no agents are seeded  with  the  disease after the
                         initial seeding

Runtime optimization:
  --threads THREADS, -t THREADS
                         Specify  the  number   of   threads   to  use  for
                         execution (default: 8)
  --log-properties LOGPROPERTIES
                         (default: logging.properties)
  --connect-pansim, -c   If this argument is  present,  the simulation will
                         run  in  PANSIM  mode,  meaning  it  will  sendthe
                         generated behavior to  the  PANSIM environment. If
                         absent,  no  PANSIM   connection  is  required,but
                         behavior is not interpreted (default: false)
  --output-dir OUTPUTDIR, -o OUTPUTDIR
                         Specify a sub directory  of  "output" where output
                         files of the  behavior  model  will  be stored. By
                         default,  the  current  time  code  will  be  used
                         (default: 2021-01-18T10:36:49.998184)
